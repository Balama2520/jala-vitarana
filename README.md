**Founded by Bala Maneesh Ayanala**

## 🌟 Vision
Jala Vitarana is more than a platform; it is a movement for **Water Justice**. By leveraging next-gen technology to bridge the gap between people who need water and people who can provide it, we have created a "Zero-Trust" ecosystem where every drop is verified, and every rupee is accounted for.

> "Clean water is a right, not a privilege. Jala Vitarana ensures that dignity and transparency are at the core of distribution."

## 🚀 Key Features
- **💎 Dynamic Goal Logic**: The distribution capacity grows automatically. Starting at a base of 9 bottles, every ₹10 sponsored adds +1 bottle to the daily mission.
- **🛡️ Abuse Prevention**: Integrated 30-day cooldown period per user (phone-based) to ensure fair distribution across the community.
- **📊 Real-Time Transparency**: A 30-second live sync engine connects the frontend dashboard directly to Google Sheet analytics for "Ground Truth" reporting.
- **🎫 Thermal Receipt UI**: Professional, printable water vouchers designed for high-contrast physical distribution, including QR codes and blockchain-grade hashes.
- **🤖 Jala Intelligence Agent**: A built-in AI support layer trained to provide professional guidance on redemption, impact, and trust.
- **📺 Live Mission Monitor**: Draggable, real-time analytics panel for live operational tracking.
