# 🌍 **JALA VITARANA**

## Free Water Distribution with Transparency, Dignity, and Trust

---

## 1️⃣ INTRODUCTION (LOCKED)

**Jala Vitarana** is a public initiative that provides **free drinking water** to people, supported by **community contributions**, **monthly sponsors**, and **responsible investment**, using **simple and transparent systems**.

The initiative is **founded and operated by Bala**, who is responsible for daily operations, transparency, and accountability.

> **Jala Vitarana exists to ensure that free water reaches people with dignity, proof, and honesty.**

---

## 2️⃣ CORE PRINCIPLE (NEVER CHANGE)

> **We limit supply, never people.**
> **We confirm distribution, never judge users.**

Every decision, feature, and word in Jala Vitarana follows this rule.

---

## 3️⃣ HOW FREE WATER DISTRIBUTION WORKS (FINAL)

### Step 1: Public Transparency (Before Anything Else)

The website clearly shows:

* Today’s sponsor (or “Community Support”)
* Total bottles available today
* Bottles distributed so far
* Remaining bottles

Everyone sees the same information.

---

### Step 2: Open Access

* No login
* No signup
* No eligibility rules
* Anyone can approach

User enters:

* Name
* City
* Phone number (for record only)

---

### Step 3: Website-Generated Confirmation Code

* If bottles are available, the website generates a **temporary confirmation code**
* The code is shown **directly on the website**
* No SMS, no Firebase, no external service

The code exists **only to confirm one bottle distribution**.

---

### Step 4: Confirmation & Distribution

* One bottle is given
* Remaining count reduces by one
* User sees:

```
Water distributed successfully.
Thank you for visiting Jala Vitarana.
```

---

### Step 5: When Supply Is Finished

When all bottles are distributed, the system shows:

```
Today’s free water distribution is completed.
All available bottles have been distributed.
Next distribution will be announced soon.
```

No rejection.
No comparison.
No “lucky” or “unlucky”.

---

## 4️⃣ PUBLIC SUPPORT SYSTEM (₹1 / ₹5 / ₹10+)

This is **support**, not investment.

### Purpose

To allow **anyone** to help provide free water, even with a small amount.

### How it works

* Users can support with ₹1, ₹5, ₹10, or more
* Payment via UPI QR / GPay / PhonePe / Paytm
* After payment, users send a screenshot for confirmation

---

### Clear Impact Mapping (LOCKED)

```
₹1  – supports operations
₹5  – contributes to water distribution
₹10 – helps provide 1 water bottle to a person
```

---

### What supporters receive

* Confirmation receipt
* Optional name/brand acknowledgment (only if they want)
* Proof photos of distribution

---

### Mandatory Disclaimer (DO NOT REMOVE)

```
This is a voluntary support contribution.
No financial return, profit, or ownership is promised.
```

---

## 5️⃣ PROOF & TRANSPARENCY SYSTEM (FINAL)

* Real photos are taken after each distribution
* Photos are uploaded to Google Drive
* Folders are organized by date, location, and sponsor
* Links are shared on the website

### Why this matters

* Anyone can verify impact
* No fake claims
* No manipulated dashboards

> **Every distribution is documented with real proof.**

---

## 6️⃣ SPONSOR PLAN (₹2520 / MONTH)

### Plan Name

**Monthly Water Sponsor Plan**

### Purpose

To fund a **fixed, transparent number of water bottles**.

### What sponsors receive

* Public sponsor visibility
* Exact bottle count
* Monthly impact summary

### What is NOT promised

* No unlimited distribution
* No guaranteed footfall
* No exaggerated marketing reach

This honesty is intentional.

---

## 7️⃣ INVESTMENT PLAN (SEPARATE & SERIOUS)

* Investment is **not public**
* Shared only with serious investors
* Used for scaling infrastructure and operations
* Formal discussion and agreement only

Public supporters are **never called investors**.

---

## 8️⃣ ACCOUNTS & USE OF FUNDS (PROTECTED & FAIR)
